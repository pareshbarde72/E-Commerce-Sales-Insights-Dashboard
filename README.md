E-Commerce Dashboard Summary 

This dashboard presents a complete visual overview of the e-commerce business performance by combining sales, delivery, logistics, and operational data into one interactive Excel workspace. It uses Pivot Charts and Slicers, allowing users to switch between product categories, delivery statuses, logistics partners, and cities without manual filtering.

The top-left chart highlights the order distribution across product categories such as Mobile, Laptop, Gaming, TV, PC, and Tablets. This helps identify which segments drive the most volume and where customer interest is consistently high. Alongside this, city-wise data is shown through a pie chart, giving a quick snapshot of major order contributors like Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai.

Logistics performance is captured through comparative bar charts. They show how different delivery partners—Fast Wheels Ltd, ShipXpress Delivery, and ShipZentrum Logistics—handle the order load. These visuals make it easy to spot which partner handles the highest traffic and where operational gaps may exist.

Customer delivery outcomes are summarized in a dedicated pie chart that breaks down delivered, cancelled, and returned orders. This is supported by a trend chart that maps order processing over time, making it simple to observe peak days, fluctuations, or any irregularities in daily deliveries.

The dashboard also tracks average shipping cost and average transit-storage time across categories and cities. These insights help understand the operational side of the business—where costs can be optimized, where delays occur, and which product categories or routes are more efficient.

E-commerce performance is driven mainly by Mobiles and Laptops, while categories like Gaming and Tablets lag behind.
Bengaluru and Delhi contribute the highest order volumes, with Kolkata showing comparatively lower demand.
Most orders are successfully delivered, with cancellations and returns staying minimal.
Fast Wheels Ltd dominates logistics operations, handling the majority of shipments.
Shipping costs and transit times vary across categories and cities, with premium products and slower-moving regions showing higher operational overhead.
